Hi! 
# I have made my project on Sathyabama Student Record System using c/c++ for the Round 3 of Techzamia.

#  In this Sathyabama Student Record System using c/c++ project, we can do basic Student Record tasks like : 
* adding the student info
* view the added student 
* search the students
* update login password

# I have included login screen in Sathyabama Student Record System, So that only Sathyabama Staffs will be able to login to this application in order to protect the data.

*This project is a Command line utility or console application whic usese C programming language. 


In this project i have used some of following C/C++ concepts and I have compiled my project with GCC compiler :

* fopen
* fread
* fwrite
* functions
* loops
* struct datatype
* if else
