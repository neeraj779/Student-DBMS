:round_pushpin: I have included login screen in this project, So that only Sathyabama Staffs will be able to login to this application in order to protect the data.

- All data which is entered by user is saved in [data.bin](https://github.com/neeraj779/Techzamia_Project/blob/main/data.bin) file and no one can access it without password.

:key: Default password and username is mentioned below.
