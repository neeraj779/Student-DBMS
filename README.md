### I have made my project on Sathyabama Student Record System using c/c++ for the Round 3 of Techzamia.

:arrow_forward: In this Sathyabama Student Record System using c/c++ project, we can do basic Student Record tasks like :

- adding the student info
- view the added student
- search the students
- update login password

:round_pushpin: I have included login screen in Sathyabama Student Record System, So that only Sathyabama Staffs will be able to login to this application in order to protect the data.

:zap: In this project i have used some of following C/C++ concepts:

&emsp;:one: fopen <br />
&emsp;:two: fread <br />
&emsp;:three: fwrite<br />
&emsp;:four: functions<br />
&emsp;:five: loops<br />
&emsp;:six: struct datatype<br />
&emsp;:seven: if else<br />
